# Voter Data Tools

This project provides tools for working with voter registration data.

## Current Functionality

- Generate sample data by randomly selecting rows from a voter registration CSV file.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Place your input file (`voter_registration.csv`) in the `data` directory.

3. Run the script to generate a sample:
    ```bash
    npm run generate-sample
    ```

The output will be saved as `output_sample.csv` in the `data` directory.
